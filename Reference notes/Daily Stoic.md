### January 02 - Education is Freedom

```ad-quote
title: Epictetus, *Discourses*, 2.121-23a
collapse: open

What is the pruit of these teachings? Only that most beautiful and proper harvest of the truly educated—tranquility, fearlessness, and freddom. We should not trust the masses who sayo nly the free can be educated, but rather the lovers of wisdom who say that only the educated are free.

Why did you pick up this book? Why pick up any book? Not to seem smarter, not to pass time on the plane, not to hear what you want to hear—there are plenty of easier choices than reading.
No, you picked up this book because you are learning how to live. Because you want to be freer, fear less, and achieve a state of peace. Education—reading and meditating on the wisdom of great minds—is not to be done for its own sake. It has a purpose.
Remember that imperative on the days you start to feel distracted, when watching television or having a snack seems like a better use of your time than reading or studying philosophy. Knowledge—self-knowledge in particular—is freedom.

### January 03 - Be Ruthless To The Things That Don't Matter

```ad-quote
title: Seneca, *On the Brevity of Life*, 3.3b
collapse: open

How many have laid waste to your life when you weren't aware of what you were losing, how much was wasted in pointless grief, foolish joy, greedy desire, adn social amusements—how litte of your own was left to you. You will realize you are dying before your time!
```

One of the hardest things to do in life is to say "No." To invitations, to requests, to obligations, to the stuff that everyone else is doing. Even harder is saying no to certain time-consuming emotions: anger, excitement, distraction, obsession, lust. None of these impulses feels like a big deal by itself, but run amok, they become a commitment like anything else.
If you're not careful, these are precisely the impositions that will overwhelm and consume your life. Do you ever wonder how you can get some of your time back, how you can fell less busy? Start by learning the power of "No!"—as in "No, thank you," and "No, I'm not going to get caught up in that," and "No, I just can't right now." It may hurt some feelings. It may turn people off. It may take some hard work. But the more you say no to the things that don't matter, the more you can say yes to the things that do. This will let you live and enjoy your life—the life *you* want.
### January 03 - The Big Three

```ad-quote
title: Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 9.6
collapse: open

All you need are these: certainty of judgement in the present moment; action for the commod good in the present moment; and an attitude of gratitude in the present moment for anything that comes your way.
```

Perception, Action. Will. Those are the three overlapping but critical disciplines of Stoicism. There's more to the philosophy certainly—and we could spend all day talking about the unique beliefs of the various Stoics: "This is what Heraclitus thought..." "Zeno is from Citium, a city in Cyprus, and he believed..." But would such facts really help you day to day? What clarity does trivia provide?
Instead, the following little reminder sums up the three most essential parts of Stoic philosophy worth carrying with you every day, into every decision:

Control your perceptions.
Direct your actions properly.
Willingly accept what's outside your control.

That's all we need to do.

### January 03 - The Big Three

```ad-quote
title: Seneca, On Tranquility of Mind, 12.5
collapse: open

Let all your efforts be directed to something, let it keep that end it view. It's no  activity that disturbs people, but false conceptions of things that drive them mad.
```

Law 29 of *The 48 Laws of Power* is: Plan All The Way To The End. Robert Greene writes, "By planning to the end you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances and you will know when to stop. Gently guide fortune and help determine the future by thinking far ahead." The second habit in *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People* is: begin with an end in mind.
Having an end in mind is no guarantee that you'll reach it—no Stoic would tolerate that assumption—but *not* having an end in mind is a guarantee you won't. To the Stoics,  oiêsis (false conceptions) are responsible not just for disturbances in the soul but for chaotic and dysfunctional lives and operations. When your efforts are not directed at a cause or a purpose, how will you know what to do day in and day out? How will you know what to say no to and what to say yes to? How will know when you've had enough, when you've reached your goal, when you've gotten off track, if you've never defined what those things are?
The answer is that you cannot. And so you are driven into failure—or worse, into madness by the oblivion of directionlessness.

### April 27 - Turn It Inside Out
```ad-quote
title: Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.21
collapse: open

Turn it inside out and see it is like ─ what it becomes like when old, sick, or prostituting itself. How short-lived the praiser and the praised, the one who remembers and the remembered. Remembered in some corner of these parts, and even there not in the same way by all, or even by one. And the whole earth is but a mere speck.
```
Stoicism is about looking at things from every angle ─ and certain situations are easier to understand from different perspectives. In potentially negative situations, the objective, even superficial gaze might actually be superior. That view might let us see things clearly without diving too much into what they might represent or what might have caused them. In other situations, particularly those that involve something impressive or praiseworthy, another approach, like that of contemptuous expressions, is helpful. By examining situations from the inside out, we can be less daunted by them, less likely to be swayed by them.
Dig into your fear of death or obscurity, and what will you find? Turn some fancy ceremony inside out and you'll find ─ what?

### April 28 -  Wants Make You A Servant
```ad-quote
title: Seneca, Thyestes, 440
collapse: open

Tantalus: The highest power is ─
Tyestes: No power, if you desire nothing.
```
In the modern world, our interactions with tyranny are a bit more voluntary than they were in ancient times. We put up with our controlling boss, though we could probably get a different job if we wanted. We change how we dress or refrain from saying what we actually think? Because we want to fit in with some cool group. We put up with cruel critics or customers? Because we want their approval. In these cases, their power exists because of our wants. You change that, and you're free.
The late fashion photographer Bill Cunningham occasionally declined to invoice magazines for his work. When a young upstart asked him why that was, Cunningham's response was epic: "If you don't take money, they can't tell you what to do, kid."
Remember: taking the money, wanting the money ─ proverbially or literally ─ makes you a servant to the people who have it. Indifference to it, as Seneca put it, turns the highest power into no power, at least as far as your life is concerned.
### May 2 - Be The Person You Want To Be
```ad-quote
title: Epictetus, Discourses, 3.23.1-2a
collapse: open

First tell yourself what kind of person you want to be, then do what you have to do. For in nearly every pursuit we see this to be the case. Those in athletic pursuit first choose the sport they want, and then do that work.

```
An archer is highly unlikely to hit a target she did not aim for. The same goes for you, whatever your target. You are certain to miss the target if you don't bother to draw back and fire. Our perceptions and principles guide us in the selection of what we want ─ but ultimately our actions determine whether we get there or not.
So yes, spend some time ─ real, uninterrupted time ─ thinking about what's important to you, what your priorities are. Then, work toward that and forsake all the others. It's not enough to wish and hope. One must act ─ and act right.
### May 12 - Kindness Is Always The Right Response
```ad-quote
title: Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 11.18.5.9a
collapse: open

Kindness is invincible, but only when it's sincere, with no hypocrisy or faking. For what can even the most malicious person do if you keep showing kindness and, if given the chance, you gently point out where they went wrong ─ right as they are trying to harm you?

```
What if the next time you were treated meanly, you didn't just restrain yourself from fighting back ─ what if you responded with unmitigated kindness? What if you could "love your enemies, do good to those who hate you?" What kind of effect do you think that would have?
The Bible says that when you can do something nice and caring to a hateful enemy, it is like "heap(ing) burning coals on his head." The expected reaction to hatred is more hatred. When someone says something pointed or mean today, they expect you to respond in kind ─ not with *kindness*. When that doesn't happen, they are embarrassed. It's a shock to their system ─ it makes them and you better.
Most rudeness, meanness, and cruelty are a mask for deep-seated weakness. Kindness in these situations is only possible for people of great strength. You have that strength. Use it.
