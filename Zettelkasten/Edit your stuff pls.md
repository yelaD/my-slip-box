# Edit your stuff pls
Here's a necessary step if you want to put out somewhat decent written content out into the world.

Editing.

Why? Because the first version of anything usually have a high chance of sucking, and being subparâ€¦

And as a general rule, do not edit immediately after a writing session, the content is still fresh in your brain, being an objective editor might prove itself difficult.
