# Using your own mortality as a compass

Death is but a moment, maybe shorter.

But living, and living well, I may add, that takes an entire lifetime.

Most people will never realize this truth. And that's a shame.

So, let's not group ourselves with those guys. And let's spend a bit more time in silence, contemplating our own inevitable demise. Let's do more of that huh.

Why? Because I say so, also because, people who are way smarter and wiser than I am have said that thinking about your death will help keep things in perspective. You'll see how little time you actually have left to do good in this world, and that will cause you to take action (hopefully).
