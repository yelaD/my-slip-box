# On mediocre work
It is an inevitable feeling to not be satisfied with your work as you're just starting out on a new skill, and I think this holds more truth if it's creative work. Now, one sure fire way of combating this feeling of dissatisfaction is by making stuff. Just create things. The only catch is, you'll have to make a humongous amount of things.

So might as well start now.
