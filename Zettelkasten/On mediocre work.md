# On mediocre work
It is an inevitable feeling to not be satisfied with your work as you're just starting out on a new skill, and I think this holds more truth if it's creative work. Now, one sure fire way of combating this feeling of dissatisfaction is by making stuff. Just create things. 

The only catch is, you'll have to make a humongous volume of things. And most of those things will likely suck, but just in the beginning. You'll start sucking less and less after each thing you make, and hopefully one day, your level of skill will have reached a point where you're satisfied with what you create (though you'll probably never reach this point).

So might as well start now.
